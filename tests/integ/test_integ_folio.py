Subject: Contract Review Request - Software License Agreement

Dear Legal Team,

I need your review of a software license agreement for our new cloud infrastructure project.
The vendor is proposing a 3-year term with automatic renewal clauses. Please check the 
intellectual property rights section and data privacy provisions.

The agreement includes:
- Software licensing terms
- Service level agreements
- Data processing requirements
- Confidentiality obligations

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
John Smith
